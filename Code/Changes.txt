Changes relative to published CPC version from April 2014:
----------------------------------------------------------


Step 1.0:

- Fortran90 standard for indentation.

- dynamic.f90: Enforce two-body analysis and writeing of restart file 
               at end of run, eben if not multiple of 'mrest'.

- forces.data: SLy4d corrected

- main3d.f90: New variable "nofsave" to maintain two-body structure
              after restart.
 
 

Step 2.0:

- energies.f90: New variables to store previous energy fluctuationas.

- main3d.f90: No new ortho-normalization after restart.

- meanfield.f90: 'workden', 'workvec', 'pwwk', 'pswk2' made ALLOCATABLE. 
                 Stabilized treatment of l*s potential. Better but
                 slower. Old version kept in 'meanfield-old.f90'.

- static.f90: Accelerated iteration by flexible step size.
              'npsi' always set to even for consistent pairing.

- New makefiles 'Makefile.gfortran' and 'Makefile.gfortran.openmp'
  which invoke more optimizations.

- Eliminate guru mode in FFTW3 to make the code compatible with
  Intels MKL implementation of FFTW3.
