Changes relative to published CPC version from April 2014:
----------------------------------------------------------


Step 1.0:

- Fortran90 standard for indentation.

- dynamic.f90: Enforce two-body analysis and writeing of restart file 
               at end of run, eben if not multiple of 'mrest'.

- forces.data: SLy4d corrected

- main3d.f90: New variable "nofsave" to maintain two-body structure
              after restart.
 
 

Step 2.0:

- energies.f90: New variables to store previous energy fluctuationas.

- main3d.f90: No new ortho-normalization after restart.

- meanfield.f90: 'workden', 'workvec', 'pwwk', 'pswk2' made ALLOCATABLE. 
                 Stabilized treatment of l*s potential. Better but
                 slower. Old version kept in 'meanfield-old.f90'.

- static.f90: Accelerated iteration by flexible step size.
              'npsi' always set to even for consistent pairing.

- New makefiles 'Makefile.gfortran' and 'Makefile.gfortran.openmp'
  which invoke more optimizations.

- Eliminate guru mode in FFTW3 to make the code compatible with
  Intels MKL implementation of FFTW3.

- Separate 'getin_external' and 'init_external' to avoid singularity
  in isovector external field.


- Local arrays in subroutine made allocatable arrays.


Step 3.0:

-all files: Added comments for documentation with doxygen

-static.f90: Exchanged Lapack routine ZHBEVD with ZHEEVD

-Makefile: combined all Makefiles into one. The tartgets are:

seq: produces the sequential code with gfortran.(default)
mpi: produces MPI parallelized code (flags are fit for gfortran).
omp: produces OpenMP parallelized code with gfortran.
debug, seq_debug: sequential code with debug flags with gfortran.
omp_debug: OpenMP with debug flags with gfortran.
mpi_debug:MPI with debug flags. 
mpi-omp: produces code with hybrid OpenMP+MPI parallelization(flags are fit for gfortran). 
ifort ifort_seq: sequential code with ifort.
ifort_omp: OpenMP parallelized code with ifort.
