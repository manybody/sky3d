This file complements the files Changes.txt and Changes_private.txt 
with a protocol of changes for the astro branch:

- Derivative routines 'cederx' etc modified to include twisted angle
  boundary conditions (new input parameters 'bangx',  'bangy',
  'bangz' to be netred via namelist 'grid').

- Compute and print detailed energy terms in sorting according to
  the 'C...' parameters of Dobaczewski at al.

- Accelerated static iteration. OpenMP version of orthogonalization
  and diagonialization.

- Option for strictly periodic systems for astro-physical applications.

- External guiding potential with periodic structures to drive
  static iteration toward wanted periodic geometries (e.g. gyroid).

- A couple of 'user...' files for initializing different peridioc
  geometries.

- New and more flexible makeile 'Makefile.all' to be used as follows:
  make -f Makefile.all <target>
  <target> can be one of the following:
  seq              : sequential program is compiled with gfortran
  mpi              : MPI parallelized program is compiled with mpif90
  omp              : OpenMP parallelized program is compiled with gfortran
  debug, seq_debug : sequential program is compiled with gfortran and 
                     debugging compiler options
  mpi_debug        : MPI parallelized program is compiled with mpif90
                     and debugging compiler options
  omp_debug        : OpenMP parallelized program is compiled with gfortran 
                     and debugging compiler options
