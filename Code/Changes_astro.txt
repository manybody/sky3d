This file complements the files Changes.txt and Changes_private.txt 
with a protocol of changes for the astro branch:

- Derivative routines 'cederx' etc modified to include Bloch
  boundary conditions (new input parameters 'bangx',  'bangy',
  'bangz' to be netred via namelist 'grid'(in units of pi)). Can 
  only be run with TFFT=.True..

- Compute and print detailed energy terms in sorting according to
  the 'C...' parameters of Dobaczewski at al.

- Accelerated static iteration. OpenMP version of orthogonalization
  and diagonialization.

- Option for strictly periodic systems for astro-physical applications.

- External guiding potential with periodic structures to drive
  static iteration toward wanted periodic geometries. The new input 
  parameters are 'outerpot' and 'outertype':
  'outerpot', INTEGER:       Defines how many iterations the guiding 
    potential is turned on.
  'outertype', CHARACTER(1): Defines the form of the guiding potential.
    Can be one of the following:
    'P': P-surface. 
    'G': Gyroid.
    'S': Slab.
    'R': Rod.
    'H': Hexagonal rod. Here it must hold: L_y=L_x*sqrt(3). 

- A couple of 'user...' files for initializing different peridioc
  geometries.

- New and more flexible makeile 'Makefile.all' to be used as follows:
  make -f Makefile.all <target>
  <target> can be one of the following:
  seq              : sequential program is compiled with gfortran
  mpi              : MPI parallelized program is compiled with mpif90
  omp              : OpenMP parallelized program is compiled with gfortran
  debug, seq_debug : sequential program is compiled with gfortran and 
                     debugging compiler options
  mpi_debug        : MPI parallelized program is compiled with mpif90
                     and debugging compiler options
  omp_debug        : OpenMP parallelized program is compiled with gfortran 
                     and debugging compiler options
