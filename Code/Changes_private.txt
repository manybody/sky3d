This file complements 'Changes.txt' with a protocol of changes
for the private branch 'master' only:


- Dipole excitations inserted in 'external.f90'.

- Some analyzing routines (spin dipole, momentum space properties)
  collected in 'user_PGR.f90'. These need explicit calls and coding
  to be activated.
  
- absorbing boundary conditions implemented 
  (special obseravbles as PES and PAD yet to be done).

- protocol of energy and particle-number difference to initial state.
