We discuss the conservation of angular momentum in nuclear

representation of wave functions and potentials on a
three-dimensional cartesian grid. Free rotation of a deformed
nucleus performs extremely well even for relatively coarse spatial
grids. Heavy ion collisions produce a highly excited compound system
associated with substantial nucleon emission. These emitted nucleons
reach the bounds of the numerical box which leads to a decrease of
angular momentum.  We discuss strategies to distinguish the
physically justified loss from numerical artifacts.

abstract={
We present a survey of the phenomenological adjustment of the
parameters of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model for a
self-consistent description of nuclear structure and low-energy
excitations. A large sample of reliable input data from nuclear bulk
properties (energy, radii, surface thickness) is selected guided by
the criterion that ground-state correlations should remain small.
Least squares fitting techniques are used to determine the SHF
parameters which accommodate best the given input data. The question of
the predictive value of the adjustment is scrutinized by performing
systematic variations with respect to chosen nuclear matter properties
(incompressibility, effective mass, symmetry energy, and sum-rule
enhancement factor).  We find that the ground-state data, although
representing a large sample, leave a broad range of choices, i.e. a
broad range of nuclear matter properties. Information from giant
resonances is added to pin down more precisely the open features. We
then apply the set of newly adjusted parameterizations to several more
detailed observables such as neutron skin, isotope shifts, and super-heavy
elements. The techniques of least-squares fitting provide safe
estimates for the uncertainties of such extrapolations. The
systematic variation of forces allows to disentangle the various
influences on a given observable and to estimate the predictive value
of the SHF model. The results depend very much on the observable
under consideration.

We search for nonlinear effects in nuclear giant resonances (GRs), in

that end, we employ a spectral analysis of time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(TDHF) dynamics using Skyrme forces. Based on TDHF calculations over a
wide range of excitation amplitudes, we explore the collectivity and
degree of harmonic motion in these modes.  Both GR modes turn out to
be highly harmonic in heavy nuclei from A=100 on. There is no trace of
a transition to irregular motion and multiple resonances are
predicted. Slight anharmonicities are seen for light nuclei,
particularly for $^{16}$O. These are mainly caused by the spin-orbit
splitting.

We review the present status of self-consistent mean-field models

The phenomenological adjustment of the model parameters is discussed

abstract={
The collective ground-state correlations stemming from low-lying
quadrupole excitations are computed microscopically.  To that end, the
self-consistent mean-field model is employed on the basis of the
Skyrme-Hartre-Fock (SHF) functional augmented by BCS pairing. The
microscopic-macroscopic mapping is achieved by quadrupole-constrained
mean-field  calculations which are processed further in the
generator-coordinate method (GCM) at the level of the Gaussian overlap
approximation (GOA).
%
We study the correlation effects on energy, charge radii, and surface
thickness for a great variety of semi-magic nuclei. A key issue is to
work out the influence of variations of the SHF functional. We find
that collective ground-state correlations (GSC) are robust under
change of nuclear bulk properties (e.g., effective mass, symmetry
energy) or of spin-orbit coupling. Some dependence on the pairing
strength is observed. This, however, does not change the general
conclusion that collective GSC obey a general pattern and that their
magnitudes are rather independent of the actual SHF parameters.

abstract={
We discuss the pairing gap, the most important observable of nuclear
pairing correlations, in the framework of self--consistent nuclear mean--field
models. The equations for the conventional BCS model and the approximate
projection--before--variation Lipkin--Nogami method are formulated in
terms of local density functionals for the effective interaction.
We perform an approximate particle--number projection of both the
mean--field energy and the pairing energy.
Various definitions of the pairing gap are discussed as three--point,
four--point and five--point mass--difference formulas,
averaged matrix elements of the pairing potential
and single--quasiparticle energies.
Experimental values for the pairing gap are compared with calculations
employing both a delta pairing force and a density--dependent delta
interaction in the BCS and Lipkin--Nogami model. We find that the
five--point mass difference formula gives a very good approximation
for the pairing gap, other approximations may differ up to $30\%$
from the five--point gaps for certain nuclei.

By calculating the Wigner distribution function in the
reaction plane, we are able to probe the phase-space behavior in
time-dependent Hartree-Fock during a heavy-ion collision in a
consistent framework. \PGR{Various} 
expectation values of operators are calculated
by evaluating the corresponding integrals over the
Wigner function. In this approach it is straightforward to define and
analyze quantities even locally. We compare the Wigner distribution
function with the smoothed Husimi distribution function.  Different
reaction scenarios are presented by analyzing central and non-central
$^{16}O+$$^{16}O$ and $^{96}Zr+$$^{132}Sn$ collisions. Although we
observe strong dissipation in the time evolution of global
observables there is no evidence for complete equilibration in the
local analysis of the Wigner function. Due to the fact that the
initial
phase-space volumes of the fragments barely merge and mean values of
the observables are conserved in fusion reactions over thousands of
fm/c we conclude that time-dependent Hartree-Fock provides a good
description for the early stage of a heavy-ion collision but does not
provide a mechanism to change the phase space structure in a
dramatic way necessary to obtain complete equilibration.

We present a review of recent applications of self-consistent
relativistic mean-field models to exotic nuclear structure. Based on
concepts of non-renormalizable effective relativistic field theories
and density functional theory, these models provide a rich theoretical
framework for studies of nuclei along the valley of \u03b2-stability,
exotic nuclei with extreme ground-state isospin values and close to
the particle drip lines. A quantitative microscopic description of
ground states and properties of excited states in nuclei far from
stability necessitates a unified description of mean-field and pairing
correlations. The relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) model has been
employed in studies of structure phenomena that include: the
description of the neutron drip line in light nuclei and the
microscopic mechanism for the formation of neutron halos; the
reduction of the effective spin-orbit interaction and the resulting
modification of surface properties in drip line nuclei; the
suppression of shell effects and the onset of deformation and shape
coexistence in neutron-rich nuclei; nuclei at the proton drip-line and
ground-state proton emitters in the region of deformed rare-earth
nuclei; shape coexistence phenomena in neutron-deficient nuclei. The
cranked RHB framework has been used for the description of rotational
excitations: superdeformed and highly deformed rotational bands in the
mass A \u223c 60 region, rotational bands built on superdeformed
minima in the A \u223c 140.150 and the A \u223c 190 mass regions, and
on normal deformed minima in the rare-earth region, smooth termination
of rotational bands, rotational and quasiparticle properties of the
heaviest actinide nuclei. The relativistic random phase approximation
(RRPA) has been employed in studies of nuclear compression modes,
nuclear matter asymmetry energy, multipole giant resonances and
low-lying collective states in spherical nuclei, the evolution of the
low-lying isovector dipole response in nuclei with a large neutron
excess, pygmy resonances, isoscalar dipole and toroidal dipole
resonances. The relativistic quasiparticle RPA, formulated in the
canonical single-nucleon basis of the RHB, has been applied in the
description of the low-energy multipole response of unstable weakly
bound nuclei. The self-consistent relativistic mean-field framework
has been extended to include density-dependent meson-nucleon vertex
functions. Compared with standard relativistic effective interactions
with non-linear meson-exchange terms, the density-dependent
meson-nucleon couplings provide an improved description of asymmetric
nuclear matter, neutron matter and nuclei far from
stability. Effective density-dependent interactions have also been
used in relativistic (Q)RPA calculations of giant resonances, and in a
microscopic analysis of the nuclear matter compressibility and
symmetry energy.}
